First bread of the year is probably the simplest one I could make. Quick (for bread),
fairly low effort and with a 50/50 mix of white flour and whole-wheat flour. It's
also a good excuse to try out one of my Christmas presents - a rectangular wicker
banneton. Although it came out a little flat and weird (my mistake!), it's still
pretty nice. All bread is beautiful.

Remember kids: always flour your banneton thoroughly!

#### Ingredients

- 250g white flour
- 250g whole-wheat flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 7g fresh yeast
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 300ml likewarm water

#### Algorithm

1. Mix the 2 flours, yeast and salt in a mixing bowl. Pour in the olive oil and
water and mix well with a wooden spoon. Remove the dough onto a floured surface
(not too much though - the dough is already quite dry) and knead until smooth and
springy.

2. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm. I tend to use a
neutral oil here instead of olive oil. Leave the dough to rise until it has
doubled in volume - usually around an hour.

3. Pre-heat oven and baking stone to about 200°C/fan 200°C, with a baking tray
placed at the bottom of the oven. Punch the air out of the dough and put in a
**well floured** banneton. If not using one, mould the dough into a ball and place
on baking paper with the mixing bowl covering it. Leave the dough to double in
volume again for about an hour.

4. Dust the loaf with flour and score the surface to control it's expansion. Bake
in the oven for about 25-30 minutes - until it turns a nice dark/golden brown colour.

5. Cool on a rack for about 10 minutes. Then enjoy!
