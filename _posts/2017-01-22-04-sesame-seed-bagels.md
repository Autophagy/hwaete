Bagels are something I've wanted to try for a while and luckily *The Bread Bible*
had a great looking recipe that I gave a shot. Since this was an experimental batch
I used half the amount the full recipe proscribed which produced 5 (very nice!)
bagels. I used sesame seeds as a topping since I had them on hand, but in future
I may try poppy seeds or onion.

I was pretty satisfied with the end result - the bagels were quite solid on the
outside and really chewy inside (in a nice, satisfying way). In the next batch I
try I will probably submerge the bagels in the boiling water for less time and see
if that produces a softer exterior.

I will also work on my shaping technique!

#### Ingredients

##### Dough Starter (Sponge)

- 234g white flour
- 4g fresh yeast
- 266ml lukewarm water

##### Flour Mixture

- 21g unsalted butter
- 182g white flour
- 4g fresh yeast
- 10g brown sugar
- 10g salt
- 0.5 tsp black pepper

##### Water Bath

- 50g sugar
- 1 tsp baking soda

##### Glaze and Toppings

- 2 egg whites
- 1 tsp cold water
- handful of sesame seeds

#### Algorithm

1. Make the sponge by combining the dough starter ingredients in a large bowl and
whisking together until smooth.

2. Combine the flour, yeast, sugar, salt and pepper in a bowl and gently scoop on
top of the sponge to cover it. Cover the bowl with cling film and leave to rest
somewhere warm for 2 hours. During this time, the sponge will bubble up through
the flour layer in places.

3. Add the butter to the sponge/flour mixture and combine with a wooden spoon.
Knead the dough for 5 minutes and then let it rest for 20 minutes underneath the
upturned bowl, as this will make it easier to work with. Then knead for another
5-10 minutes, until it is smooth and bounces back when you indent it.

4. Put the dough in a suitably oiled rising container and cover it with cling film.
Leave it to rise somewhere warm for an hour, until doubled. Deflate the dough,
give a business letter turn and put it back into the container. Let it rise in the
fridge for 4 hours. Before you shape it, let it stand at room temperature for 30 mins.

5. Divide the dough into 5 balls and shape into bagels. Make the holes wider than
you would think, since they will puff up during the boiling and baking stage. Let them
rest under a towel for 10 minutes.

6. Preheat the oven to  230Â°C. Bring a large pot of water to the boil and add the
sugar and baking soda. Stir until dissolved. Put the bagels in 2 at a time and
flip them over after 1 minute or so. Let the bagels rest on an *oiled* parchment
sheet while you submerge the rest of the bagels.

7. Whisk together the egg whites and cold water, and glaze the bagels with a brush.
Sprinkle the sesame seeds on top of the glazing.

8. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven (preferably on top of a baking stone) and
let them bake for 25 minutes. Turn off the oven and *without opening it* let the
bagels rest for 5 minutes. Open the oven door and let the bagels rest for a further
5 minutes.

9. Transfer to a wire rack and let them cool completely.
