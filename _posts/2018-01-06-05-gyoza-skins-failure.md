Been a long time since I posted something here! Last spring my camera was stolen
in Rome, and I lost a bit of the will to photograph anything I was making with
my shitty cameraphone. However, I recently got a slightly nicer phone, and thought
i should post stuff here again. So, please excuse the quality of the pictures.
Hopefully I'll get myself a nicer camera again at some point.

As the title of this post might suggest, I tried to make gyoza skins and pretty
much catastrophically failed in doing so! The kneading and rolling out of the
skins was good work out, but I neglected to put enough corn starch between the
skins when stacking them when I was finished. In the end, about 4/5 skins had
fused together and were unusable. I did buy some frozen ones just in case something
like this might happen, but it was pretty disheartening.

I did end up using the surviving 1/5 of my skins, and they turned out pretty
tasty with a pork, onion, cabage, soy sauce and sake filling.

Next time, I will remember to seperate the skins properly, maybe on seperate
plates. Oops.
