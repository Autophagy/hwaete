The recipe for these *amazingly* fluffy and soft bread rolls was found at
[Curious Nut](http://www.curiousnut.com/hokkaido-milk-rolls/). I substituted
2 tablespoons of honey for 2 tablespoons of sugar, as I had run out.
This recipe uses a milk based [Tang Zhong](https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/recipes_wiki/Tang_zhong)
and I had no thermometer, so I had to kind of guess when it was at the right temperature.
Everything turned out super nice, and I'm definitely eating all of these as quickly
as humanly possible for breakfast tomorrow.

I'm replicating the ingredients list here in metric for future reference.
