<p>A suggestion from <a href="https://twitter.com/joshavanier">Josh Avanier</a> prompted me to
try and make lembas, the elven waybread from The Lord of the Rings.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to pin down exactly what Lembas is. My initial thought was that,
given the lifespan of lembas, it’s a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardtack">hardtack</a>.
I didn’t particularily feel like making hardtack.</p>

<p>However, Gimli describes it as much more plesant than Cram (which, from the sounds
of it, is <em>definitely</em> a kind of hardtack) and the elves describe it as ‘sweet’.
Given this, as well as the description of it being golden outside and cream
inside, I thought making some form of shortbread would be more fitting.</p>

<p>The recipe itself is pretty simple. I used a combination of sugar and honey for
some more interesting flavour, as well as a whole lemons worth of zest. This was
definitely worth it - the end result was crumbly and really delicious!</p>

<p>Alas, I had no mallorn leaves to wrap them in, so I made do with tin foil instead.
They should keep for a couple days, if kept wrapped.</p>

<h4 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
  <li>500g white flour</li>
  <li>235g butter</li>
  <li>60g honey</li>
  <li>100g brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 lemon worth of zest</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Preheat oven to 160°C.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cut the butter into cubes and bring up to room temperature, so they are are
soft and workable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cream together the softened butter, sugar and honey in a large mixing bowl.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the flour and combine. The dough will initially be very crumbly, so combining
and compressing/kneading with your hands in the bowl can help bring it together. If
the dough is refusing to come together and is too crumbly, add in a little bit of
softened or melted butter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Roll the dough out to the desired thickness - about 60mm. Cut into squares,
and lightly score the surface (no futher than half way through the dough) with
an X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bake the waybreads on a parchment sheet for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown
on the outside.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove from oven and let them cool on a wire wrack. <em>Be careful</em> at this point,
before they have cooled down they are still soft, and can break apart.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wrap in mallorn leaves, and set off for Mordor with your fellowship.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
